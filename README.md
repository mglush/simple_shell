# OS Project: Building a Simple Shell
#### By Michael Glushchenko

This project implements the following:  
- a shell that can take in any of the UNIX shell commands.  
- redirection characters '>' and '<' to be used with the shell commands.  
- commands can be chained with the pipe sign '|' (the simple shell can only bind a max of 3 commands this way).
