# Simple Shell Implementation in C
#### By Michael Glushchenko for UCSB CS170 Spring 2023.

This is the first project I did for UCSB CS170 S23. It implements the following:  
- a shell that can take in any of the Linux shell commands.  
- input and output can be redirected with the meta-characters '<' and '>' (limited to only one of each per command).  
- commands can be chained with the pipe sign '|' (any number of commands can be chained together).  
- commands and arguments most be separated by at least one space.
